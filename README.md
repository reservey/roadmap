# Roadmap for Reservey

Welcome to the Reservey Roadmap! This document provides an overview of our product development plans and outlines the key phases and features we're working on.

## Reservey Public Roadmap

ðŸ”— View the official Reservey public product roadmap [here](https://github.com/orgs/reservey/projects/1).

Our product roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. Have any questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Share your feedback via Reservey public feedback discussions.

The roadmap repository is for communicating Reserveyâ€™s roadmap. Existing issues are currently read-only, and we are locking conversations, as we get started. Interaction limits are also in place to ensure issues originate from Reservey. Weâ€™re planning to iterate on the format of the roadmap itself, and we see potential to engage more in discussions about the future of Reservey products and features. If you have feedback about this roadmap repository itself, such as how the issues are presented, let us know through general feedback in Reservey public feedback discussions.

## Guide to the Roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with labels that indicate the following:

- **Release Phase:** Describes the next expected phase of the roadmap item. See below for a guide to release phases.
- **Feature Area:** Indicates the area of the product to which the item belongs.
- **Feature:** Indicates the feature or product to which the item belongs.
- **Deployment Models:** Indicates whether the feature will be available in the cloud, server, and/or GHAE (Reservey Actions Environment).

Once a feature is delivered, the "shipped" label will be applied to the roadmap issue, and the issue will be closed with a comment linking to the relevant Changelog post.

### Release Phases

Release phases indicate the stages that the product or feature goes through, from early testing to general availability:

- **alpha:** Primarily for testing and feedback
  - Limited availability, requires pre-release agreement.
  - Features still under heavy development and subject to change.
  - Not for production use, and no documentation, SLAs, or support provided.

- **beta:** Publicly available in full or limited capacity
  - Features mostly complete and documented.
  - Timeline and requirements for GA usually published.
  - No SLAs or support provided.

- **ga:** Generally available to all customers
  - Ready for production use with associated SLA and technical support obligations.
  - Approximately 1-2 quarters from Beta.

Some of our features may still be in the exploratory stages and have no timeframe available. These are included in the roadmap only for early feedback. They are marked as follows:

- **in design:** Feature in the discovery phase. We have decided to build this feature but are still figuring out how.
- **exploring:** Feature under consideration. We are considering building this feature and gathering feedback on it.

Thank you for your interest in Reservey's development. We value your feedback and look forward to delivering new and exciting features to enhance your experience!
